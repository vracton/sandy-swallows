As you travel through Eastern Upside-Down Island, you become dazed by the upside down trees. Sooner or later, you're stuck on the Sandy Swallows, and with high tide coming in, there's no way you can head back... With nothing but sand in sight, you decide to carve out a help signal. However, you might as well have some fun..!
